/**
 * An interceptor that provides an additional service to a {@code Context}.  A context service interceptor is created
 * for every context service for each context.  Upon creation, the interceptors are tied together using the {@code
 * setNext}/{@code setPrevious} methods.  Afterwards, the {@code processXXX} methods are invoked to handle data coming
 * in or going out through the context.
 * <p/>
 * The interceptor {@code processXXX} methods are expected to delegate to the next or previous interceptor after
 * performing the required processing.  This diagram illustrates the relationship between interceptors and the Remoting
 * core: <p><img src="Interceptors.png" alt="Diagram depicting the relationship between interceptors and the Remoting
 * core"/></p>
 * <p/>
 * The general rule is that outbound process methods delegate to the next handler, and inbound process methods delegate
 * to the previous handler.  The methods may make exceptions in certain circumstances, as described in the method
 * documentation, in order to "short-circuit" the request mechanism or to affect message delivery in a service-specific
 * way.
 * <p/>
 * The methods {@code processInboundRequest}, {@code processInboundMessage}, {@code processOutboundReply}, and {@code
 * processOutboundException} all operate on the responding ("server") side of the context.
